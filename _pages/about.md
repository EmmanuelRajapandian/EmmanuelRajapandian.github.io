**Bio:** I am a Business Analyst at Amazon conducting research/analyses and building models to drive ASIN Conversion through Causal AI, Machine Learning, and Statistical Modeling. Currently pursuing my Masters in DataScience from UT Austin [Expected 2024] while juggling my job. In my prior professional role, I served as a Data Scientist developing new credit underwriting by constructing predictive models utilizing XGBoost to predict the likelihood of loan delinquency for customers in specific loan portfolios in the US subprime market conditions. I helped generate 400k dollar revenue every month for the analytics project I took ownership of. Earned my bachelor's degree in EE from the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Chennai.

**Outside of Work:**
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m diving deep into the latest research papers on LLMs, Causal Inference(s), Prompt-Engineering to stay up-to date in these ever evolving fields. I try to comprehend the thoughts and processes underlying the content of these papers.
- ðŸŒ± I apply any newly encountered tech stacks from my readings to various datasets, gearing up for future roles that leverage these technologies. 
- ðŸ¤” I've been exploring Causal ML and Advanced Prompt Engineering in LLMs. My intention is to apply these concepts in projects, as I believe that hands-on experience and application are more effective in enhancing understanding compared to mere reading.
- ðŸ˜„ I've built vision based racing simulator system and a RL-DL agent to play SuperTuxKart Ice Hockey as part of my Masters program. The challenge was tough but I learnt a lot from the basics of neural layers all the way to deep neural networks.
- ðŸ˜Ž I occasionally engage in Speedcubing, finding it to be a mental stimulant that enhances my thinking abilities and an excellent means of relaxation. Good at solving the Pyraminx (Former National Runner-up 2018)! I was once ranked 3rd in India, 10th in Asia, 32nd in the World. Owing to tighter schedules, I attend competitions rarely.

excerpt: 'In this project, I leveraged Python 3.5+ along with libraries such as numpy, nltk, and spaCy to perform binary sentiment classification on a dataset of movie review snippets from Rotten Tomatoes. The dataset consisted of sentences labeled as either positive or negative, with neutral sentiments excluded. Followed the standard machine learning workflow by reading in the data, training classifiers, and testing their performance on divided datasets, including training, development, and blind test sets. Specifically used a Naive Bayes classifier for this task and employed the CountVectorizer from sklearn to convert text data into numerical vectors, which allowed to train the classifier effectively. After splitting the data into training and testing sets, I trained the classifier on the training data and evaluated its accuracy on the test set. This process provided valuable insights into handling text data and applying machine learning algorithms to real-world problems, enhancing my ability to design features and train classifiers for text analysis tasks.'

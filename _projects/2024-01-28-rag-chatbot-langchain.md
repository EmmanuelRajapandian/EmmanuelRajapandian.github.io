excerpt: 'Leveraged the capabilities of LangChain, 8-bit quantized Falcon-7B LLM, Chroma DB to create a sophisticated chatbot developed and equipped with the capacity to learn from the external world through Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Speed-cubing has been a part of my hobbies for the past 10 years and I decided to build the chatbot by extracting data from the official WCA website, it guidelines, regulations and other data. This dataset forms the bedrock, enabling the chatbot to respond adeptly to queries regarding the queries related to speed-cubing, its rules and guidelines. Built a functioning chatbot (notebook version for now) and RAG pipeline that can hold a conversation and provide informative responses based on the WCA data.The exploration promises a deep dive into the construction of an intelligent conversational agent.'
